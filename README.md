# Array-calculator 
An Integer and String Array Calculator implemented in MIPS assembly language as a part of Computer Organization Assignment.

**Overview**

This program is an Integer and String Array Calculator implemented in MIPS assembly language. The user can choose between two options: performing calculations
on an integer array or performing various operations on a string array. The program provides different functionalities for each option, such as calculating the 
average and maximum value for integer arrays, and checking for a palindrome, comparing two strings, and formatting sentences with proper spacing for string arrays.

**Features :**

**1)** Integer Array Calculator :

  Print Array: Displays the elements of the integer array.

   Calculate Average: Computes and prints the average of all elements in the integer array.

   Calculate Maximum Value: Finds and prints the maximum value in the integer array.


**2)** String Array Operations :

  Check for a Palindrome: Asks the user to enter a string and determines whether it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

  Compare Two Strings: Allows the user to input two strings and compares them to check if they are equal or not.

  Sentence Spacing: Takes an input string and formats it, adding a newline after every space character to create a properly spaced sentence. 


Exiting the Program :

After performing the operations, the user is presented with the option to either start the program again or exit
